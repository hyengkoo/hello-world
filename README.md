<h2>Github best practices</h2>
<h3>Inserting code into github comments</h3>
If you want to insert code into any github comments, use the "<>" (insert code) button. You will get two apostrophes, '', where you will insert your code like this:

'code'

The code should come out with a grey background surrounding the code you typed. 
If there is a problem, check the ' ' carefully!

<h2>Linux best practices</h2>
<h3>Regarding file names for uploaded file</h3>
If a file name includes a space (" "), Linux will change the space in the name to a backlash space("\ ").

Thus, whenever we want to upload a file, change the name to not have any spaces (" ").
Change the file according to the following rubric:

Dad Hello.jpeg -> Dad_Hello.jpeg
<h2>html best practices</h2>
