<h3>Inserting code into github comments</h3>
If you want to insert code into any github comments, use the "<>" (insert code) button. You will get two apostrophes, '', where you will insert your code like this:

'code'

The code should come out with a grey background surrounding the code you typed. 
If there is a problem, check the ' ' carefully!
